### iOS-Specific Enhancements

#### 🎯 Haptic Feedback System
- **Button Taps** - Light haptic for button presses

- **Tab Selection** - Selection feedback for tab changes
- **Success/Error** - Notification haptics for actions
- **Pull-to-Refresh** - Medium haptic for refresh actions

#### 🎨 iOS 18 Design Language
- **Material Backgrounds** - Translucent, depth-aware surfaces
- **Dynamic Colors** - System colors that adapt to light/dark mode
- **Rounded Corners** - Consistent 12-16pt corner radius
- **Gradient Accents** - Blue to purple gradients for primary actions
- **Proper Typography** - System font with appropriate weights

#### ✨ Smooth Animations
- **State Transitions** - Implicit animations for state changes
- **Loading States** - Animated skeletons and progress indicators
- **Navigation** - Native iOS navigation transitions
- **Pull-to-Refresh** - Native refresh control animations
- **Micro-interactions** - Subtle animations for user feedback

### Key Design Decisions

#### Native vs Hybrid Approach
- **Native Implementation**: Core features (auth, profile, search, match recording)
- **Web View Integration**: Complex features (validation queue, match details)
- **Ratio**: ~90% native, ~10% web views (as requested)

#### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for large lists
- Image caching with AsyncImage
- Pagination for match history
- Debounced search queries
- Prepared haptic generators

#### User Experience
- Consistent haptic feedback on all interactions
- Loading states for all async operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Pull-to-refresh on all data lists
- Proper keyboard handling and focus management

## 🎯 iOS 18+ Features Utilized

### Design System
- **Materials** - `.regularMaterial` for cards and backgrounds
- **Dynamic Colors** - System colors that adapt to appearance
- **SF Symbols** - Native icon system with proper weights
- **Typography** - Dynamic Type support with system fonts

### Platform Integration
- **Keychain Services** - Secure credential storage
- **Haptic Feedback** - Full range of haptic types
- **Safe Area** - Proper handling of notches and home indicators
- **Dark Mode** - Automatic appearance adaptation

### Modern Swift Features
- **Async/Await** - Modern concurrency patterns
- **@MainActor** - UI thread safety
- **Structured Concurrency** - Proper task management
- **Swift 6.0** - Latest language features

## 🔄 API Integration

### Implemented Endpoints
- `POST /auth/v1/login` - Authentication
- `GET /auth/v1/refresh` - Token refresh
- `GET /user/v1/profile` - User profile
- `GET /match/v1/history` - Match history
- `POST /player/v1/search` - Player search
- `GET /user/calculated/v1.0/stats/{id}` - User statistics
- `GET /activity/v1.1/user/{id}/followingInfo` - Follow info
- `POST /activity/v1.1/user/{id}/follow` - Follow/unfollow

### Error Handling
- Network error recovery
- Token refresh on 401 errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Haptic feedback for errors

## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Visual Design
- **Clean Interface** - Minimal, focused design
- **Consistent Spacing** - 12-20pt spacing throughout
- **Card-Based Layout** - Information grouped in material cards
- **Color Hierarchy** - Primary, secondary, and accent colors
- **Proper Contrast** - Accessible color combinations

### Interaction Design
- **Immediate Feedback** - Haptics on every interaction
- **Loading States** - Skeleton screens while loading
