# Gemini Prompting Notes for Open DUPR

## Comments and Code Style
- Produce self-documenting code. Favor clear names and small, composable functions.
- Do not leave commented-out code. Delete unused code instead.
- Only add comments for non-obvious "why"—document rationale, constraints, or tradeoffs that cannot be expressed in code.
- Avoid comments that restate what the code says, TODOs without owners, and decorative section headers.
