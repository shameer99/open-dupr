# Open DUPR

## What

Open DUPR is an open-source, ad-free, and user-friendly web client for the DUPR pickleball rating system. It is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to function as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for a fast, app-like experience on any device.

## Why

The official DUPR website suffers from a cluttered user interface, intrusive ads, and a restrictive paywall that complicates the user experience. This project aims to provide a clean, fast, and secure way for pickleball players to access their DUPR rating and data without the noise. We believe in providing a better, more open platform for the global pickleball community.
