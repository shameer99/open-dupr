# Cursor Rules for Open DUPR Project

## Package Manager

- Always use `bun` as the package manager instead of npm or yarn
- Use bun commands for installing dependencies, running scripts, etc.

## Git Operations

- Do not perform any git operations (add, commit, push, pull, etc.)
- Avoid git-related commands and let the user handle version control

## Code Verification

- After making code changes, verify them by running the project's linting and type-checking commands
- Find these commands in package.json or other configuration files
- Do NOT run the full development server
- Examples: `bun run lint`, `bun run build`

## User Verification

- The user is running the server and will verify functionality after each prompt completes
- Defer to the user for final verification of features and functionality
- Focus on code correctness rather than runtime testing

## Comments Policy

- Use comments very rarely and sparingly
- Never comment out code - delete unused code instead
- Only add comments to explain the 'why' behind code when it's not obvious for a good reason
- Prefer self-documenting code over comments

## Code Quality

- Ensure code is clean, readable, and follows TypeScript/React best practices
- Focus on type safety and proper error handling
- Write maintainable and scalable code
